        <h3>Instead of just plain white cupcakes, I took it a step further and made them special. You can change the
            colors
            for any holiday. Shades of green for St. Patrick's Day, pastel colors for Easter, red white and blue for the
            4th
            of July. You get the picture.</h3>

    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups water</li>
            <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>3 egg whites</li>

        <h3>Directions/Steps: </h3>

    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a standard muffin tin with paper cupcake liners.
            </li>
            <li>Beat the cake mix, water, vegetable oil, and egg whites together on low speed for 30 seconds, then on medium
                for 2 minutes, until smooth. Fill cupcake liners 1/3 full with white batter; set aside.</li>
            <li>Stir 4 drops of red food coloring into the remaining bowl of batter to make the batter pink. Stir in the
                raspberry oil. Pour 1/3 of pink batter into a resealable plastic bag and set aside.</li>
            <li>Mix more food coloring into the remaining bowl of pink batter until it is an orange/red color and pour the
                batter into a resealable plastic bag. Cut a corner off the bag, stick the open tip into the center of each
                cup of white batter and squeeze in about two tablespoons of red batter.</li>
            <li>Cut the corner off the bag with the pink batter, stick the open tip into the center of the red batter and
                squeeze about 1 tablespoon pink batter into each cup.</li>
            <li>Bake the layered cupcakes in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean,
                15 to 20 minutes. Cool completely before frosting.</li>
        </ol>
